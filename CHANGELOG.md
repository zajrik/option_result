## 3.1.3

- Fix code snippet in readme.

## 3.1.2

- Clean up `flatten()` implementations.
- Add source links to docs.

## 3.1.1

- Update README.

## 3.1.0

- Add `value` field shorthand getters for `Option` types.
- Add `value` field shorthand getters for `Result` types.

## 3.0.1

- Fix README formatting.

## 3.0.0

- Add `call()` extension for the following types to allow calling them like a function
  for easy unwrapping of their `Option`/`Result` values:
  - `Future<Option<T>>`
  - `FutureOr<Option<T>>`
  - `Future<Result<T, E>>`
  - `FutureOr<Result<T, E>>`

### Breaking changes

- Remove deprecated `~` operator for `Option` and `Result` type values.
- Remove `~` operator for `Result<(), E>` type values.
  - The only reason this was added was to keep `~await failableOperation()` ergonomic,
  but this can be accomplished with a `call()` extension on `Future`/`FutureOr`
  values which keeps the quick method of unwrapping `Option`/`Result` values consistent
  accross the library.

	- `~a + ~b` became `a() + b()`
	- `~optionFn()` became `optionFn()()`
	- `~resultFn()` became `resultFn()()` and now:
	- `~await optionFnAsync()` becomes `await optionFnAsync()()`
	- `~await resultFnAsync()` becomes `await resultFnAsync()()`

## 2.2.0

- Un-deprecate `~` operator for `Result<(), E>` type values
  - This keeps the ergonomics of `~` for unwrapping awaited Results, but only where
  the value would be discarded anyway, i.e., unwrapping a result that is only used
  for error handling inside a `catchResult` or `catchResultAsync` block so that the
  error can propagate.

## 2.1.0

- Add `Option.call()` to allow calling `Option` values like a function to unwrap
  their held values.
- Add `Result.call()` to allow calling `Result` values like a function to unwrap
  their held values.

### Deprecation

- Deprecated `~` operators for `Option` and `Result` types.
  - Use `Option/Result.call()` as `value()` to unwrap with minimal syntax instead.
    - This prevents the need for accommodating operator precedence when unwrapping
      `Option`/`Result` values which provides a more ergonomic experience when accessing
      values/methods on the unwrapped value is needed.

## 2.0.1

- Remove work-in-progress message from readme.
  - How did I miss this?
    - help

## 2.0.0

### Breaking changes

- Remove `~` shortcut for prefixing Option/Result propagation functions.
  - I failed to test the most obvious use-case. Due to the lack of generics on operators,
  when both variants of `Option` or `Result` are returned in the same prefixed function,
  the return type is inferred by the compiler to be `Object` and the propagation
  extensions then fail to recognize the function as a valid target for the `~` operator.

    To compensate, I made the Option/Result propagation helpers easier to type by
  renaming them, saving 4 characters and 2 syllables. It's the best I can think of
  until such time that Dart supposed fully generic operator definitions.
- Rename `propagateOption()` -> `catchOption()`.
- Rename `propagateResult()` -> `catchResult()`.
- Rename `propagateOptionAsync()` -> `catchOptionAsync()`.
- Rename `propagateResultAsync()` -> `catchResultAsync()`.

## 1.0.0

- Final documentation update for 1.0.0 release. ðŸŽ‰

## 0.1.0-dev-4

- Update documentation.

## 0.1.0-dev-3

- Allow `const` `Option` and `Result` values.
- Rename `Option#filter()` -> `Option#where()`.
  - This is more Dart-idiomatic.

## 0.1.0-dev-2

- Add `Option#iter()`.
- Add `Result#iter()`.

## 0.1.0-dev-1

- Add `Option#toString()`.
- Add `Result#toString()`.
- Rework `==` for `Option` and `Result` types.
  - Previously `==` would check for matching runtime types in addition to held value equality.
  I was trying to keep things as close to Rust's behavior as I could. It didn't occur to me
  until after I rewrote it to be more accommodating of `dynamic` values that it didn't support
  comparing held values that inherit from eachother that might normally be comparable in both
  the original implementation and the rewrite so I scrapped both in favor of solely comparing
  held values.

## 0.0.1-dev-9

- Add `Result#transpose()`, `ok()`, `err()`.

## 0.0.1-dev-8

- Add `Option#unwrapOrElse()`, `okOr()`, `okOrElse()`, `transpose()`.

- Add `Result#inspect()`, `inspectErr()`.

## 0.0.1-dev-6

- Refactor `~` shortcut for `propagateResult/Async` to return dynamic for ergonomics.
  - See documentation for more information.

## 0.0.1-dev-5

- Add `~` operator for unwrapping `Option` and `Result` types.
- Add `~` operator as shortcut for propagating `None()`/`Err()` in functions returning `Option`/`Result`.
- Rework `Option#unzip()` via extension methods to only provide the method on `Option<(T, U)>` values.

## 0.0.1-dev-1
